Cell Tower Population Estimation
================================

Work for Thyago


Notes
-----

Data file is ignored from git since it is so large. There should be a file in this directory, named ```CIV10adjv3.asc``` for everything to work. If not, the Abidjan dataset may be used; it is located in ```abidjan```.


Procedure
---------

0. (Optional) Run ```./clustering.py``` to cluster cell towers together

1. Open ```Voronoi Cell Towers/tesselation2.html``` in an HTML5 web browser to calculate Voronoi Tesselation. ```tesselation2.html``` already includes the Ivory Coast cell tower dataset which can be updated/replaced using ```setup.sh```.

2. Click "Export Geometries to CSV"

3. Save the resultant data to a file (```polygons.dat``` for example, saved as WKT (Well Known Text))

3. Run ```./Voronoi\ Cell\ Towers/polygon_processor.rb [polygon-datafile]``` to convert the Voronoi datafile to a CSV which is saved at ```Voronoi Cell Towers/OUTPUT/parsed_polygons.csv```

4. Run ```./grid_converter.py input_file geometry_file output_file``` to convert the population grid-map to a CSV with longitude, latitude, population

5. Run ```./population_estimator.py Voronoi\ Cell\ Towers/OUTPUT/parsed_polygons.csv gridconverter_output_file populations``` to actually estimate the population for each cell tower polygon, stored in a CSV file with tower_id, population
